Heartbeataria is a mod that aims to bring unique content from Chinese Regional versions of Terraria back to global version of the game.

This includes:
- Chinese-exclusive Terraria x KFC collab
- Cut content from old Mainland China Mobile Edition of the game
- 9 new pets
- 18 new vanity sets
- 5 new mounts
- 27 new paintings

This mod doesn't affect the balance of vanilla game in an impactful way, so you can safely play it along with bigger content mods like Thorium or Calamity without problems.

It is highly recommended to play this mod alongside Consolaria (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2864843929)
